// Program 211: Design a Soccer player class that includes three integer fields: a
// playerâ€™s jersey number, number of goals, number of assists and necessary
// constructors to initialize the data members. Overload the > Operator (greater
// than). One player is considered greater than another if the sum of goals plus
// assists is greater than of the others. Create an array of 11 soccer players, then
// use the overloaded > operator to find the player who has the greatest total of
// goals plus assists.
